# cliff-assessment
Data Visualiser


I have completed the assessment, but there are still some area of improvements and some problems to solve.
1. Application is not responsive.
2. I was not able to implement the anamoly part in the graph, still tried.
3. The code can be more modularised, like the client side can have more sub components.

Steps to run the app locally.
1. git clone clone-url
2. cd server && npm install
3. cd client && npm install
4. npm run build
5. cd ..
6. npm run start:dev
